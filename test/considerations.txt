Test considerations
*******************

1. Execute usecases offline, then start sync tool
2. Execute usecases while watching
3. Execute usecases with different modes (2way, push, pull)
4. Execute usecases on different platforms

Usecases:
1. File Synchronization
1.1. Local file and remote file exist
1.1.1. Change file locally only (causes an upload; skipped with pull)
1.1.2. Change file remotely only (causes a download, skipped with push)
1.1.3. Change file remotely and locally (causes a merge conflict; in push mode it simply uploads) - SHOULD ADD PULL
1.1.4. Change file remotely and locally (same content, should not cause a conflict)
1.2. Local file does not exist and remote file exists
1.2.1. Delete file locally, no change remotely (causes delete file remotely; skipped with pull)
1.2.2. Delete file locally, changed remotely (causes merge conflict; in push mode it simply deletes remotely) - SHOULD ADD PULL
1.3. Local file exist and remote file does not exists
1.3.1. Delete file remotely, no change locally (causes delete file locally; skipped with push)
1.3.2. Delete file remotely, changed locally (causes merge conflict; in push mode it simply uploads) - SHOULD ADD PULL

2. File Handling
2.1. New file (uploads file)
2.2. Deleted file (deletes file or 1.)
2.3. Updated file (see 1.)
2.4. Renamed file (renames remote file)

3. Directory Handling
3.1. New directory (creates directory remotely)
3.2. Deleted directory (deletes remote directory; NOTE: if individual files are updated within the hierarchy they are deleted)
3.3. Renamed directory (renames remote directory)

4. Resolve Merge conflicts
4.1. Resolve with local file
4.2. Resolve with remote file
4.3. Resolve through delete

5. TBD

More testcases to be written
